# Valve VRM Format Documentation
I have here documented the "VRM" file format Valve was working on back when TF2 was subtitled "Brotherhood of Arms".
My documentation can be found in the [valve-vrm-docs.md](valve-vrm-docs.md) file in this repo.

I have tested the included Python script on the only VRM I know to exist, which is in the 2023 Gigaleak with the path `hl2/models/Weapons/V_physcannon/Older/TESTreference.vRM`.

External info on the format:
* [VRM on VDC](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VRM) (I have added my documentation to this article AFTER having documented it in this repo)
* [An article about VRM on ValveArchive](https://valvearchive.com/articles/vrm/)
