# Valve VRM Format Documentation
I have here documented the "VRM" file format Valve was working on back when TF2 was subtitled "Brotherhood of Arms".
My documentation can be found in the valve-vrm-docs.md file in this repo.

I have tested the included Python script on the only VRM I know to exist, which is in the 2023 Gigaleak with the path `hl2/models/Weapons/V_physcannon/Older/TESTreference.vRM`.

External info on the format:
* VRM on VDC: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VRM
* An article about VRM on ValveArchive: https://valvearchive.com/articles/vrm/
